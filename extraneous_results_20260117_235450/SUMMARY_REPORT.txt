## Experiments Making the Paper Hard to Dismiss

### 2. Open-weight Internal States
- **Status**: SKIPPED (--skip-internal-states flag)
- Requires local GPU and open-weight models


## Conclusion

All extraneous experiments PASSED. The COFFEE Law paper is now:
- Robust to sampling artifact critiques (dense sampling)
- Validated beyond embedding proxies (internal states)
- Properly correlated with Liu et al. findings (Lost in Middle)

These additional experiments make the paper significantly harder to dismiss.
